# carbon-calculator v0.11
# Version 0.11

# What started this
This started out as a down and dirty attempt to create a calculator that calculates the COÂ² emissions measured in pounds and reported in tons. I wanted a way to let visitors to my website calculate what their carbon emissions were and what I could help them save.  

# To-Do List
There are still things that need to be done. It should already be RWD ready.  It has to be cleaned up some and maybe better documented. LSHint suggests dot notation would likely be useful for the conversion variables.

# Like to see
I envision the calculator as a popup that displays in  front the current webpage.  Everything should display properly in the window viewport it opens in.

Please retain the  copyright and give me credit if you use or modify the code.  Add your change notes to the end of this README file and update the version number in the carbon-calcultor.php file.

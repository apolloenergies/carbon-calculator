# carbon-calculator v0.11
# Version 0.11
This started out as a down and dirty attenpt to create a calcualtor that calcaulates the COÂ² emitted from the fuels you use in your home or office.  It's calculated in lbs and reported in tons.  

There are still things that need to be done, but it should be RWD ready.  Some dot notation would likely be useful for the variables.

I envision the calculator to look likeit opens up in front the current webpage.  Everything should display properly in the window viewport it opens in.

Please retain tge copyright and give me credit if  you use or modify the software.  Add your changs to the top of the carbon-calcultor.php file, and update this README file.
